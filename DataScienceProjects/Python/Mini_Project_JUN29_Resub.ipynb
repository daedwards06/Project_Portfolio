    "Understanding the differences between theoretical statistical procedures and SVM helps to determine the advantages and disadvantages, and both are dependent on the type of data to be modeled.  Real-world, statistical methods usually rely on scientifically based statistical procedures (Anguita, Ghio, Greco, Oneto, & Ridella).  These methods split the data into a training dataset and a hold-out set.  The training set it used to create a model, while the hold-out set is used for computing the generalization error estimation (Anguita, Et. Al.).  As stable as these practical methods are, they tend to find a separating hyperplane, but not usually an optimal one (Berwick).\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM MLT’s goal is to maximize the margin around the separating hyperplane (Berwick).  The “support vectors are the elements of the training set that would change the position of the dividing hyperplane if removed” (Berlick). In a post on Stack Exchange, Gavin Simpson outlines a few advantages and disadvantages of SVM.  One not so significant advantage he points out is a simple one, that SVM has a “regularization parameter” that assists the user to avoid over-fitting.  He also believes that since it uses the “kernel trick” it can build in expert knowledge about a problem using by engineering the kernel (Simpson).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, SVM has a learning phase that finds a set of parameters by using quadratic programming, usually the search for the most optimal parameters does not complete and additional tuning must be done (Anguita, Et. Al.).  Using optimization techniques, such as Lagrange multipliers, can aid to get the data into an arrangement that can be solved analytically (Berwick).  Simpson noted one disadvantages is that the SVM theory only covers the “determination of the parameters for a given value of the regularization and kernel parameters and choice of kernel”.\n",
    "\n",
    "There doesn’t seem to be much difference in performance based on the information provided, and we believe it is dependent on the imbalance prevalent on our response variable (y), where the difference in the number of instances between class 0 and class 1 are important considering that class 0 holds about 92.5% of the data. This imbalance definitely influenced the accuracy scores, particularly when there was no cost set for any missclassification of false negatives or positives. Now we know that we could have prevented this by creating a cost matrix in which we can assign lower costs to the true positive, a higher cost to those false negatives, and lower but positive cost to the false positives, and then multiply it by the each of the confusion matrices. That way we could obtain a more reliable and realistic accuracy score regarding the number of people that were reported as dead when they did not die in an accident and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to base our model decision on the accuracy scores retrieved by either the logistic regression or the SVM, this will be a difficult task because the range of accuracy scores of the logistic regression with 10 fold cross-validation was from 92.1% - 92.4%, while the accuracy retrieved by SVM achieved a 92.5%. There is just 1% difference between the highest end of the range of logistic regression models and SVM, but a 1% could mean a world of difference when it comes to prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, based on the confusion matrices provided by each of the models, in which SVM returned one where there were no false negatives due to the imbalance of the data which cause a high sensitivity in which no cost was assigned to the false positives, and based on this the logistic regression seem as a more efficient model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of training time and efficiency, SVM seems a much more complicated model because it involves transforming the data and the use of kernels and also because perhaps because we are more familiar with logistic regression which we have seen previously but at the end of the day, if the data is cleaned, and correctly splitted into training and testing sets, both models represent an efficient way to classify data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the dimensionality reduction of the data using PCA represented a challenge regarding the correct interpretation of the data considering that python does not provide a covariance matrix in which we could have detected which attributes had a higher covariance in each of the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was more of a difference within the model by choosing one parameter (cost) over another.  We observed that the lower the cost, the higher the accuracy.  This makes sense because C is the “penalty on the slack variables which measure the degree to which the margin constraints are violated” (Chin).  For our data, there wasn’t a significant difference.  It is more beneficial to look within the regression model and fine tune it rather than use SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data illustrates what Edwin Chin stated on his blog, “better data often beats better algorithms”.  That holds true for our data set which is why both models performed well.   \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The first two components (0 and 1) and the last one (3)--also the \"heaviest\" one with a weight of 0.604316844227--  are positively correlated. The second component has a negative weight of -0.00157791612436 (for that reason it is not displayed on the graph), which makes it the \"lighest\" one and the only one that is negatively correlated to the rest. (It is beyond our understanding why the plot is only showing positive weight values.)\n",

    "Regarding component 0, which array of values is [-5.34418077 -8.09625071 -4.50701903  1.56495696], we can definitely notice that the first three elements are negatively correlated, being -4.50701903 the highest negative loading, while the fourth element possesses the highest positive loading of 1.56495696.\n",
    "\n",
    "For component 1, which array of values is [ 17.45764237  12.41880561   6.60591012   2.22248572], we can see that all of the elements are positively correlated with the first two elements displaying the highest loadings at 17.45764237 and 12.41880561. \n",

The highest positive loading is located on the third element with 5.62585816.\n",

Just by looking at the loadings it is easy to understand why this component is the heaviest one not only because three of its elements are positive while only one is negative, but because the first element displays the highest loading of all of the components with a value of 29.2995645. Definitely this first element is responsible for the total weight of the component itself. \n",

    "Although PCA itself standardizes the data, we would like to see if \"normalizing\" the components of the training set creates a change that could be benefitial by scaling the four components to see if the third, and heaviest, could become more similar in its weight to the rest. \n"
